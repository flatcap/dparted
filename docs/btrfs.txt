btrfs test cases

fs, volume, subvols

subvols are children
icon in area, children in tree
need to be creative with sizes/used totals

what's different between test cases 1 & 2?
which tree does test2/fs appear in?
	normal -> fs
	volume -> fs*n

subclass volume as BtrfsVolume AND Btrfs?
subclass subvol as BtrfsPartition AND Btrfs?
	BtrfsPartial?
