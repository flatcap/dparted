Updates -- keep object in sync

table update - identify unique trait
	!slot, name type, etc
	offset changes when part is moved
pre-move: update object offset value
move succeeds => reunite table with object
move fails => RESCAN ALL (drop all objects)

table update
	children++
	children--
		existing children, same seq num
		new child inserted
		old child (empty weak ptr) row deleted
How do I keep the original objects?
Gfx -- complete refresh wouldn't be visible (list, too)
Tree -- pattern of expanded nodes would be lost!
