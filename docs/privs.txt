Privilege Separation

Three binaries
	dparted		cli
	dparted-gui	gui
	dparted-worker	privileged worker

Commands
	pvs, lvs, vgs
	mount, umount, swapon, swapoff

Files/Proc
	/dev
		allow devices based on their kernel major/minor
		(to allow for links and aliases we hadn't though of)
	/proc	most of this should be off-limits
	/etc	for privileged config

	/usr/lib/dparted/	don't know what for, yet
	/var/lib/dparted/

Memory
	mmap devices

Need to limit access to:
	files (for read/write/mmap)
	memory areas (read/write)
	commands run

Plugin "X" would like permission to run "P, Q, R"
	(X) Once
	( ) Always
	need a revoke menu too
	need to store settings in a privileged place, /etc

Plugins from
	/usr/lib/dparted/	safe
	/usr/libexec/dparted/
	~/.dparted/		unsafe

main.cpp
	#include <unistd.h>
	#include <sys/types.h>
	std::cout << getuid() << std::endl;
	std::cout << geteuid() << std::endl;
