How many people have TL pointer?
	all 3 Block::discovers
	each Block::discover gets a BlockSet!
	BS name = harddisks, loop devices, files
	=> TL isn't parent of changes, BS is

Block::discover can cheat, it only ever adds new stuff
Will ::discovers ever be called elsewhere?
	"User: File/Open"?
	Still add only, still no internal need for a txn
Block::discover, then transfer its results into a *real* top-level (atomically) no txn

Volume::discover search all, or each BlockSet, for bits to join up
BlockSet name determines mount points, cryptsetup names, etc
	either use sanitised "name" as a prefix, or "BS<uniqueid>"
