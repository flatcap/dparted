Context menu: DTFSR
Main menu: DTFR

Space - ask parent for min/max/type (set)
	msdos -> primary, extended
	lvm -> linear, stripe, raid

Create filesystem on block device -- how does it work?
	block has no table -> create default table
	table has no partition -> create appropriate-sized default type
	create filesystem

How do I create the menu?
	block can have table, had default table, delegate (set of tables available)
	table can have partition, has default partition, delegate (set of partitions available)
	partition can have filesystem, no default fs?, ask (set of fs available)
