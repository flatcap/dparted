Add

right-click on area/unallocated (in partition)
area/gfx/container -> get_actions()
unallocated & base : get_actions() => none
unallocated & parents : get_actions() => ?
	wipe (from Container::)?
	Loop, gpt, part, unalloc

partition (msdos, gpt, etc) can contain filesystem
app::can_contain (GptPartition)
	GptPart : nothing specific
	Part: ext2/3/4, btrfs, etc	menu Create/Filesystem
	Container: nothing specific

app::can_contain (Loop)
	Loop : nothing specific
	Block:	table			menu Create/Partition Table (msdos, gpt, lvm, luks)
		fs			menu Create/Filesystem
	Container: nothing specific

How does Create/Filesystem become Create/Table, Partition, Filesystem?
Luks ([X] encrypt) => extra level inserted
	where can luks be inserted? -- which dialogs are affected

if create/fs => table, part, fs then create/part should be listed too
might need dedicated dialogs
create dialog:
	list gpt first
	list ext4,btrfs | others

block, part, luks, fs		can only encrypt fs, or lvm
block, luks, lvm
is block, luks, gpt allowed?
how does ubuntu encrypt home?
how do i integrate that?
