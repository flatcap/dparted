default theme has: colours, labels, icons -> DefaultTheme object?
	table = "/usr/share/icons/table.png"
who populates the default theme?  -- GuiApp?
	deriving => fine-grained custom colours, etc
need to be able to _revert_ to default theme

Menu - Theme
	Default -> object
	Zany -> load_file & icons, etc
	B&w  -> load_file & icons, etc

Missing icons, invalid colours, invalid options
	App.QueueMessages()
	App.Message() * n
	App.FlushQueue()
		Coalesce if titles are the same, e.g.
			Error reading theme files

config_file	table = "/usr/share/..."

		block.icon = "table"
theme		table -> pixbuf
		colour = RGBA
gfx_container	icon -> pixbuf
		colour = RGBA

if theme seqnum incremented => gfx_container.retheme()
if new theme, build new gfx_container tree then subst?

Objects - backup
	alter contents
	create
	delete
	move
	resize

Timestamp the timeline
	lose the changes from the last n minutes?
Follow the data/parts -> optimisations
	offer to reorder to save time?

IBackup interface on Container
Pool of *all* versions of *all* objects, ref-counted
Operations queue (of IBackups)
Deque undo/*redo*! iterator keeps current state
Anything but redo trashes future states

delete item: add to pool, remove from parent
alter (contained): add to pool

backup -> serialize???

Variant
	int
	float
	string

set by type
get by type
coerce to type
	string, promoted type

ctor (def, copy, move, typed)
cast (int, float, string)
operator(=,<<)

If I'm only looking for Variant attrs - don't need get/set method
e.g. dot visitor
	get_parent
	get_attrs -> const vector<Variant>&
		valid while you have a ContainerPtr

find by name	not uniq
find by uuid	uniq to device (hopefully)

deque
	work commit		begin()
	now (redo exists)	iter
	now (no redo)		end()

Tasks
	resizefs 5GB to 15GB
		resize part
		resize luks
		resize lvmpv
		resize lvmvol
		resize ext4
