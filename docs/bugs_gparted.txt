Damned slow - reading 9 partitions on loop

Ctrl-C, format partition, Ctrl-V pastes wrong (new fs), should fail

Gui has 5 types of action - but gives no clue which is which
	Immediate action - change partition flags
	Dialog immediate - create table
	Queue - check fs, delete
	Dialog queued - resize, insert
	No changes - mount, properties

Mixed scale numbers

Mount/swapon => refresh!

No support for Fedora/Ubuntu default install

Any operation -> rescan *all*
