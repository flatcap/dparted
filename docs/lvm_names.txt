VALID NAMES
	The following characters are valid for VG and LV names: a-z A-Z 0-9 + _ . -

	VG  and  LV  names cannot begin with a hyphen.  There are also various reserved names that are used internally by
	lvm that can not be used as LV or VG names.  A VG cannot be called anything that exists in /dev/ at the  time  of
	creation,  nor  can it be called '.' or '..'.  A LV cannot be called '.' '..' 'snapshot' or 'pvmove'. The LV name
	may also not contain the strings '_mlog', '_mimage', '_rimage', '_tdata', '_tmeta'.

if the name contains a hyphen then the /dev/mapper name will contain double-hyphen
(not in the /dev/VOLNAME/ dir, though)
