block manager
	look for new block devices, e.g. usb drive
	hmm.. will that even be partitioned?

config manager
	global config to start with
	hierarchy of names
	config specific to block device?

disk space manager
	track mounted filesystems
	trace mounted swap devices
	timer (config period)
	ties in the container hierarchy
	ties in with mount manager

file manager
	file -- single vm
	dir -- all files therein
	use dparted to manipulate vms
	option to open in nautilus
	embed nautilus in app?
	may require mounting the filesystem
	watch fuser - unmount automatically?

loop manager
	look for new loop devices
	grep test_22 -l /sys/block/loop*/loop/backing_file
	/sys/block/loop0/loop/backing_file
	find which loop device has a file

mount manager
	keep internal (current) state
	call poll function periodically
	they report back, e.g.
		- /mnt/space	directory unmounted
		+ /dev/dm-2	new path exists
	all mount handling happens here
	last mount time of unmounted filesystems
		just in case a filesystem is mounted and unmounted between scans
	periodically scan for changes in /proc/mounts?
	mmap it permanently?
	map mount list to container tree
	tie into path manager

password manager
	keep passwords externally (to the containers)
		just in case the user asks for a full refresh
	uuid -> password lookup
	mlock memory to prevent swapping

	ulimit: max locked memory (kbytes, -l) 64
	#include <unistd.h> long pagesize = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);
	#include <sys/mman.h> int mlock(const void *addr, size_t len);

paths manager
	keep internal (current) state
	call poll function periodically
	they report back, e.g.
		- /mnt/space	directory unmounted
		+ /dev/dm-2	new path exists
	find all aliases for containers we are using
	match by kernel major:minor, type
	/dev/dm-[n]
	/dev/sda
	/dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD5000AAVS-00ZTB0_WD-WCASU4948693
	/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_WDC_WD5000AAVS-_WD-WCASU4948693
	/dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x50014ee1abbf198d
	/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:12.0-scsi-0:0:0:0

theme manager
	multiset
	theme name -> config map
	multitple themes
