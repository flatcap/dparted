Undo Toolbar/Timeline

Scale will change with time (and dot positions)

Tooltips on hover, e.g.
	"Resize /dev/sda2 from 100Mib to 150Mib (About 15 minutes ago)"

Click on a change to place view after that change
Click on [Clean Slate] (button left of timeline) to undo all changes
Click on [Now] (button right of timeline) to redo all changes
	Equivalent to clicking on the last change dot

Buttons:
	|<  Rewind to beginning
	<<  Back on change
	>>  Forward one change
	>|  Forward to end

Icon on tooltip denoting type of action: Resize, Format, etc

Need to show cursor on timeline
	Eye icon instead of dot?
		See gnome guidelines about disembodied parts!
	Arrow
	Colour
		ambiguous if there's only two dots
	Box around dot [ * ]

Actions/Pending area needs clear feedback on state of Undo/Redo
	Undo actions (things done) in black
	Redo actions (in buffer) in grey
		Hard to see what you're agreeing to redo
	Just highlight viewed line/state?
	List empty => no highlight => no pending actions

Undo/Redo menus need to specify *what* they're about to do

Clean slate button = "Undo all" highlight base of arrow
Now                = "Redo all" highlight point of arrow
