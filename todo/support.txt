support for loop mounted partitions / devices (especially for VMs)

support MS LBA extended partition 0x0f

block devices
files
filesystems
tables
encryption
raid

for each block list all the subtypes supported and all the types understood but not handled

Tables
	msdos
		linear
		count <= 4
	msdos extended
		linear
	gpt
		linear
		count <= 128
	lvm
		linear
		striped
		raid
	ldm
		linear
		striped
		raid
	btrfs
		linear
		raid

	sgi - read-only
	sun - read-only

for conversion between tables we also need to know how much space is reserved
before the first partition

msdos (recent), msdos extended (recent), gpt, lvm
	all have their first partition at 1MiB

if lvm only contains simple partitions, it could be converted to an msdos table

fdisk cat create SGI and Sun partition tables
