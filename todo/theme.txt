gui
	Unknown usage -> big fat yellow '?' or icon

	needs to work if there's no theme file

	colour transparent/none

	shade = checkers

	colour-blind schema
		theme may need shading types

	if I use a stock icon on a panel
	will it be themed?

	changing the theme to "default" could re-call init_colours, etc
	send a signal afterwards to alert plugins

	need to add alpha to all the colours I use from the theme
	(even if *I* don't want to use it)
	could be used for debugging by making certain elements translucent

	colour-code table blocks in disk-gui?
	too much?
	how do we distinguish between...?
		disk, msdos, partition
		disk, lvm, partition

	use css to theme the colours,font,icons?

	theme:
		light
		dark
		auto - guess from the default colours
		custom - filename.css

	test case 12.5 a filesystem that doesn't fill the disk
		need to highlight wasted space
		red checks
			theme item

	theme contains icon names too
	plugin filesystem/table can set theme info for itself

	theme change the names to
		fs_ntfs
		fs_ext2
		table_msdos
		table_gpt
	if "table_X" doesn't exist, use "table", etc

	have own icons
	otherwise doesn't match docs
	easier to keep things aligned
	need a dark set too

	have a "dark" colour scheme

	themeable items
		colours
		icons
		sizes
		text layout
		gradients

	icons for
		partial, mirror, stripe, raid

	white curvy corners should get their colour from the theme too

	theme needs to contain
		diskgui height
		coloured bar height (hence radius)
		NOT left-tabwidth (?) - measured from ALL the icons?
		left-tabwidth - clip all the icons
	fix the icon widths and diskgui height for three modes?
		small 24	~64
		medium 48	~77
		large 48	~128

	svg icons would mean a completely scalable output

	theme get_colour
	if not in map, try rendering the string directly

cmdline
	select theme

config
	parse: #rgba values
	display: Yes, No, Hidden, Empty (zero children), Box, TabBox, Block?
	usage keyword => leaf or (children not visible)
	table theme - display -- full block
		partial => [X]__[XXX]______|
		full => [X]

css?

choose custom colours
	can't have # as a comment marker AND have #ABC as a hex colour

separate colours from drawing area & containers
	theme manager
		light
		dark
		extensible

parser checker tool / generator?

example theme -- complete (with default values) but commented out

config for ui sizes?

icon manager, name lookup for themes?
	or section in theme file

b/w theme -- how to highlight, show focus, etc?
halve width of tabs/icons to save space
	or scroll horizonally
	when there's a LOT of partitions

background / colour = check16 (checkered 16px), check7, etc

theme - nested works like css
	how to implement
		X.name
		X#name

"data" theme -- no structures, just the fs

separate label text with | (pipe), e.g.
	NW label|NE label|SW label|SE label
	(alignment)

how to specify other icons, e.g.
	read-only
	mirror
	OS type
	tie theme name to container property

theme *only* knows about strings and hierarchy

highlight theme plugin
	all objects grey except thouse matching criteria
	menubar/toggle button
	e.g. lvmvols > 80% full
	linux volumes
	window volumes
	highlight by OS (colour code by OS)
